<!-- What's the basic pitch for the Twine narrative? Where do you start? Who do you play as? What's the genre? -->
A group of neighborhood kids get together one summer night to play a game of Jail Break. One kid will be 'it' and the other 
three will hide. You will start in a quiet small-town backyard, but where you will end up is up to you. Pick your character wisely 
because in the end, there will only be one winner. 
Hopefully this thrilling game will take you back to summer nights when you were younger. 


For our collaboration, we are each going to plan out our own characters and their paths. Jared is going to be the master behind the CSS (with some suggestions and help, of course). Once we all have our basic paths down, we are going to come together and plan how to interact each character a little more to enhance the game. 
Tessa will get background images where it is applicable. 

Now add some specificity to that general plan: who will take what role, at what points? How will you communicate with each other?
We are going to communicate over text and email. 


Basic Plan: 
Hiding Places:
in the garage
under a car
behind a telephone pole 
up a tree
in an alley 
on someone's porch 
in the creepy neighbor's backyard
at the church 

Possible ways to lose: 
you get caught 
you wake up a neighbor 
you're out past curfew and your parents come looking for you
