# Project 4: Collaborative Interactive Narrative

<strong> Preview 1: 4/4 </strong>
In this preview we are showing the basic steps of our game. Right now we have CSS and the steps a player will take when playing the game. Each of the players are crossing paths and have multiple passages they can take. We are really happy with where we are right now. We had the goal of letting each person in the project make their own paths to make the game their own, so far we have accomplished that. Once we finish and are happy with the paths, we are going to use computer percentages in the code that will give the game a definitive ending and winner. We did decide every time a player hits “go home” they will lose. 

We also updated the introduction of our page and created an ending page. We do have some images to set the mood, but we will go in and make sure they fit well before the final draft. Twine was new to all of us, but we are all working together and getting the hang of it. We are also all pitching in different ideas and splitting the work. It has taken a lot of googling, but only a week into the project, we are making good strides and putting in a lot of work outside of class to help us accomplish our lofty goals for a final project. 

We have been using a collaboration method via group text. When someone gets on the twine we text to let everyone know and then we also let them know when we push something so the next person knows to pull. So far it has worked really well. We know we still have some work to do, and if we have time we would like to add sound, but for now we are happy with our progress and hope everyone enjoys our game. 
Good Luck, don’t get caught! 


**Baseline criteria**
For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:

* Contain at least 20 passages.
* Have a title screen passage containing at least the story's title, the names of your team members, and a link to a credits page if appropriate.
* Have at least one clearly identifiable ending passage.
* Include at least two passages with diverging paths leading out
* Include at least one passage with converging paths leading in <!-- Jess FitzPatrick had two -->

**Aspirational inspirations**
To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may...

* Use visuals to direct attention or advance a claim
* Use sound to convey a sense of place or mood
* Use Harlowe code or CSS to make at least two new "looks" for selected passages
* Use Harlowe code to store variables and/or introduce conditional logic (if/then behaviors)
* etc


## Collaborative Guidelines
Will be in another file, to keep this one straightforward. See [twine-and-collaboration.md](how-to/twine-and-collaboration.md).
